## Day 9

### What is Git and why is it important?
- Git is a DevOps tool used for source code management. It is a free and open-source version control system used to handle small to very large projects efficiently. 
Git is used to tracking changes in the source code, enabling multiple developers to work together on non-linear development.

### What is difference Between Main Branch and Master Branch??
- There is real difference between main and master, it's just the difference of the name of the default branch. Git push origin master just creates a new branch for you called master and pushes your current commits there if it doesn't already exists. 
The master" is just a naming convention for a new branch or we can say that master" can be a repository's "default" branch.

### Can you explain the difference between Git and GitHub?
- While Git is a tool that's used to manage multiple versions of source code edits that are then transferred to files in a Git repository, GitHub serves as a location for uploading copies of a Git repository.


### How do you create a new repository on GitHub?
- Create a directory to contain the project.
- Go into the new directory.
- Type git init.
- Write some code.
- Type git add to add the files (see the typical use page).
- Type git commit.


### What is difference between local & remote repository? How to connect local to remote?
- Local repositories reside on the computers of team members. In contrast, remote repositories are hosted on a server that is accessible for all team members - most likely on the internet or on a local network in our case github.
